# geo-open-hack-2024

GEO-OPEN-HACK-2024 is a comprehensive and informative event designed for advanced geo-coders to explore various open tools and approaches for upscaling geospatial analysis on open High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure.

The event is organised by the [International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis](https://iiasa.ac.at/) (IIASA) in collaboration with [Spatial Ecology](https://spatial-ecology.net/). This hackathon delves into advanced cutting-edge open techniques, tools, and best practices for efficiently handling and processing vast amounts of geospatial data. Participants will gain hands-on experience in leveraging HPC resources and geo-tools for tasks such as geospatial data preprocessing, spatial modeling and analytics, and visualization.
