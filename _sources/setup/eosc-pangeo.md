## The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)

Before learning how to register and access to the Pangeo@EOSC cloud service, we would like to introduce you with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

The [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/) aims at becoming the main environment for hosting and processing research data to support European Science.

## Pangeo Europe

[Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) is a worldwide community for Big Data geoscience promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science. 

[Pangeo Europe](https://pangeo.io/meeting-notes.html) aims at highlighting European contributions to the Pangeo Community and at providing a reference deployment for Pangeo on EOSC. The Pangeo deployment on EOSC has been made possible thanks to [CESNET](https://www.cesnet.cz/en/) in the context of the the [EGI-ACE project](https://youtu.be/Vc9SZNa2-Os) and the [C-SCALE project](https://youtu.be/-jBkR_2_vg8).
